## This is my pre-bootcamp repository. 

Before starting GitHub, I spent several months review key-technology basics. 
The include: 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript and JQuery
4. Sketch
5. PhotoShop
6. Illustrator

I did some additional work where I got my first real taste of working with Git, Github, and WordPress.
